- Ideally get rid of most helper functions and solve ETIMEDOUT error on server.js to handle all players in one single file.
For that i need to figure out why NBA api unstable. Because of me or its from their side. 
Looks like i have to do some Proxy config staff for that.

- fix players info section -> use second API source. First is unstable. Works on local but not on development

- sass instead of css if moved to REACTJS?

- reuse conditons on players api js files

- maybe set up a database and store news/player images.

- catch api errors and do somehting when data is not available

- change score list items to createElement attribute

- self invoking functions or think how not to invoke functions globally

- (zoom out > 50%). Remove fixed position footer and make page more organized when zoomed so that footer always stays on the bottom but fixed.
