- Ideally get rid of most helper functions and solve ETIMEDOUT error on server.js to handle all players in one single file.
For that i need to figure out why NBA api unstable. Because of me or its from their side. 
Looks like i have to do some Proxy config staff for that.

- fix player info (+) button

- sass instead of css if moved to REACTJS?

- resuse conditons on players api files

- maybe set up a database and store news images.

- catch api errors and do somehting when data is not available

- change score list items to create element attribute

- self invoking functions or think how not to invoke functions globally

- make it more responsive

- push to https://pages.github.com/
